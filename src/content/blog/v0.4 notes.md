## Explanation of this update

Well. I finally finished it. This update was originally planned to be a small update with the only changes being the changes 5-9 but then life got in the way and by that point I said screw it and rewrote most of the website. I am currently writing this on the 13/05 but I suspect that it'll be at least till the 15th before I push this to the website.

#### Anyway so from now I'll go through the changes in more detail

1. Remade the help command

I've compleatly rewritten the help command as before it was terrible. It didn't have all the commands. It included commands that didn't work. It had the commands in weird case when the command input was case insensitive. It didn't sort commands by type. Most importantly it didn't explain what the commands did, which for odvious reasons ended up confusing the users I tested it on. Anyway, now thats fixed. Now I'm not saying its perfect, but it's better.

Here is the old code:

```html
case "help":
        
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">Available commands: help, clear, aboutme, neofetch, pwd, CV, ls, sources.</p><br>';
            break;
```

And here's the new code:

```html
case "help":
        case "help":
        
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">Available commands:</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"help" - shows a list of available commands</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"aboutme" - gives some info about me</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"welcome" - displays the weclome text again</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"aboutme" - gives some info about me</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"cv" - gives a link to my CV/resume with some info taken out</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">For these next commands I have tried to do a VERY basic simulation of a linux filesystem. In future I plan to make it better but like the rest of the website it is a work in progress. You can navigate it using these commands:</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"pwd" - Prints the working directory (shows the folder you are in)</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"ls" - lists all the folders and/or files inside the current directory.</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"cd" - changes the current directory/folder you are in, this is to be used but typing "cd (the folder name you want to navigate to that is inside the current folder)" or "cd /Home/guest/(What directory you want to naviagte to)/(the optional directory that may be inside the directroy)" Please note, the folder names must be case sensitive. (This is an intentional design decision.)</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">"clear" - clears all commands above</p><br>';
        content.innerHTML += '<p class="commandresult">Commands are case insensitive but locations of folders for "cd" are not.</p><br>';
            break;
```

2. Written the sources command
I've written the output for the sources command. Currently it has 3 people/Organisations:
- Tufto

I was unsure on wether to list them as using their website as a template. However ultimatly I decided not to given that while that would have been the case in v.0.1 by now I would say that it's 90% my code, and the 10% is mostly pretty basic code. However I am VERY much still gonna keep them at the top of the sources.

- Zade

The sources give the most info about him, but he's helped me a lot.

- Astro

Not much to add.


##### There is not much to add for the rest



## Plans for Future updates
Alright here is my plans for version v.0.5 sorted into small, medium and large features. 

#### Small:
1. Change the CSS styling of the commands and/or command results so it's seperated better from itself.
2. Remake the Ascii image of myself.

#### Medium: 
1. Rewrite all comments
2. Redo HTML and CSS class names and also redo JS variable, constant, and object names because right now they are terrible.
3. Add a back button on the blog posts so that you can go back to the mainpage
4. Improve the header tags for the blog pages
#### Large:
1. Write a selection of blog posts about the different versions of this website.
2. Get this website indexed by google, now that I am actually proud of it.

#### Thanks for reading :)
